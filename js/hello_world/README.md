# Hello World Exercise

This is just a demonstration of how i want to do this little exercises.

I think that more than just learn a language, a framework, is important
to keep good practices. This exercise is a first step to that. First
good practice : Test the code! This time i wrote the tests, but i'm 
thinking on alternate who writes the code and who writes tests.

Another good practice : Everything in english, commits and all.

# How to proceed

At first check if the tests are passing

```
pair_programming/js/hello_world $ jasmine
```

[BAN! Failed!]

This is normal, is parte of the cicle of the TDD. On TDD, first you 
write tests for what you want your code to do, see them fail, write
enough code to make them pass, then refactor it.
